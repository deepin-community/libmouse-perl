libmouse-perl (2.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Upstream bumped the major version number due to a bug fix which changes
  Mouse.pm's behaviour:

    Merged the pull-request #13, which fixed an issue where the behavior
    of role method confliction was different from Moose. This change might
    affect your existing code so the major version has incremented.  See
    t/030_roles/role_conflict_and_inheritance.t for details.
